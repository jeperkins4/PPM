Feature: A Facility manager can generate indicator reports for any timeframe.
  As a Facility's manager
  I want to generate reports on indicator reviews
  For times both before and after the conversion
  So that I can report on those indicators accurately and so that I can 
  reproduce old reports.

  Background:
    Given I am a logged in manager for facility "Prison Camp"

  @wip
  Scenario: I can create a report for a date range that occured before the conversion.

  @wip
  Scenario: I can create a report for a date range that occured after the conversion.

  @wip
  Scenario: I cannot create a report for a date range that traverses the conversion date.
